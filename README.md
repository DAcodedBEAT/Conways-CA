# Conways-CA
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life Cellular Automaton in MIPS assembly.

## Description
An implementation of the cellular automaton algorithm by John Conway, known as Conways Game of Life.

This implementation is written in MIPS assembly though it could be easily ported over to other languages by following similar procedures.

## Arguments
None

## Input
  Board size, # of generations, # of initial living cells, locations of initial living cells.

## Output
  Iterations of the board over the number of generations
